The BRFSS is a health related telephone survey conducted anually by CDC. The dataset comprises responses from over 400,000 individuals focusing on various health-related risk factors. My goal was to predict whether an invidual has diabetes based on the responses and I built an entire end to end workflow to predict prevelance of diabetes in individuals using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
