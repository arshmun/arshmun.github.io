### Diabetes Prediction Using Random Forest and RNN-LSTM with CDC Survey Data -- [[View Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1j8tg9IQpLnMZbguNvT715ACqKfhf1Edo?usp=sharing)]

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual health-related telephone survey conducted by the CDC. This dataset comprises responses from over 400,000 individuals, focusing on various health-related risk factors. My goal was to predict an individual's diabetes status based on these responses. I developed a comprehensive end-to-end workflow to estimate the prevalence of diabetes in individuals, utilizing both machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### MyGPT: A Simple AI Chatbot with Custom Knowledge Base Using OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model -- [[View Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HVHzCoDj3gmLwTlzjJ3W8ovHOC5nVavi?usp=sharing)]

In this project, I developed a proof-of-concept AI chatbot capable of answering queries using a custom Knowledge Base provided by the user. While ChatGPT is impressive, it often delivers generic answers and struggles to pinpoint specifics when asked about a particular article, research paper, or textbook. My implementation attempts to address this issue by allowing users to input highly specific data, enabling the GPT model to provide answers based on this tailored information.

### Face Detection, Image Segmentation, and Object Recognition Using Computer Vision Libraries and Frameworks -- [[View Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19N4pqxoeemhHUxrX4mIcKXx-5cnulv-k?usp=sharing)]

In this project, I leveraged popular computer vision tools, algorithms, and techniques to implement various tasks. These included face detection using the Haar cascade detector, image segmentation employing the R-CNN model, and object detection in images utilising both the default and tiny versions of YOLO.

### Advanced Resume Optimisation Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning -- [[Request Code](mailto:amunif@outlook.com)]

This project involves the development of a sophisticated workflow that uses advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to optimise resumes, making them more closely align with job descriptions. The solution integrates methods such as keyword extraction, TF-IDF scoring, BERT embeddings, and transformer models for detailed text analysis and comparison. An iterative algorithm is also applied to improve the match between the resume and job description by adding missing keywords and rephrasing existing content. The code is not publicly available due to its potential for misuse however, I am open to sharing it with interested parties who can provide a compelling reason.

### Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, and Topic Modelling Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques -- [[View Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QT73I4Go8q1prt90v_V3K8dPCQecpZuQ?usp=sharing)]

In this project, I delved into various NLP techniques to achieve effective sentiment analysis, text classification, and topic modelling. The sentiment analysis was conducted on a collection of both positive and negative movie reviews, while text classification was performed on a diverse assortment of newsgroup texts. Additionally, the topic modelling was designed to accommodate any two user-selected topics.

### Image Generation with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) --  [[View Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14XIIth9H1xNRdXDW5V20G9cmZQwRaFkv?usp=sharing)]

In this project, I delved into the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks, utilising the CIFAR-10 dataset to train my models. I fine tuned and implemented both discriminator and generator components, and incorporated procedures to visualise the results. Post-training, I used the trained generator to produce a set of fabricated images, demonstrating the power of GANs.
